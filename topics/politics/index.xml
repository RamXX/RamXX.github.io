      <description>I grew up in Chile during the time of Pinochet, where &amp;lsquo;politics&amp;rsquo; was a bad word, and &amp;lsquo;politicians&amp;rsquo; were equivalent to &amp;lsquo;thugs&amp;rsquo;. Even after all these years and multiple iterations of democratically elected governments, people&amp;rsquo;s involvement in democracy is just limited to general elections every 5 years. Very little occurs in between.
You see, in my view, Chile is a place where the government does pretty much whatever it wants once it&amp;rsquo;s in power.</description>
