      <description>I first published this in 2013 but since I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked recently by several friends, I figured I update it with more current information.
For the record, Iâ€™m a CISSP, and as such, computer security is always in the top of my mind. For me, that also extends to privacy.
Since I spend a good amount of time at airports, hotels, coffee shops and generally roaming around, having a VPN service has become a necessity for me as well as for anyone who values their online privacy and safety, even at home.</description>
