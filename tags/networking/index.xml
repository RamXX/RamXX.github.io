      <description>CJDNS is an IPv6 encrypted mesh networking technology, used in Hyperborea and other mesh networks around the world. I particularly like the way it&amp;rsquo;s conceived, with end-to-end encryption, distributed IP address allocation, DHT-based source routing and MPLS-like label switching.
It has several interesting use cases, but I wanted to set it up in my pfSense gateway VM so I can use it as a distributed VPN of sorts. This could be useful to be able to access my systems from anywhere while traveling, or where my team can share access to each other&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Foundry labs, particularly when we travel.</description>

      <title>Selecting the Right VPN Service</title>

      <description>I first published this in 2013 but since I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked recently by several friends, I figured I update it with more current information.
For the record, Iâ€™m a CISSP, and as such, computer security is always in the top of my mind. For me, that also extends to privacy.
Since I spend a good amount of time at airports, hotels, coffee shops and generally roaming around, having a VPN service has become a necessity for me as well as for anyone who values their online privacy and safety, even at home.</description>
